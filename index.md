Welcome to Postgraduate Society (PGS)! The PGS is a society for all Postgraduate Students at Strathclyde. We host weekly social events, to create a strong (and fun!) postgraduate community. In addition, the PGS acts as a voice for postgraduate taught and research (PGT and PGR) students across Strathclyde and the NUS. If you would like to get involved or have any queries please feel free to get in touch.

You can find us in the Postgraduate Lounge of the Union every Friday between 12.30-1.30pm.  Just stop by for a chat!

The Postgraduate Society is here to provide a great time for postgrads at Strathclyde, whether youâ€™re here for a Master or a PhD, we hope to welcome every one of you at our events.

If you are interested in joining the Postgraduate Society come and talk to us at the Freshers Fair or [email us](mailto:pg.strath@gmail.com) to become a member.
