## Glasgow Life

Many of you will be coming to Glasgow for the first time and might not know very much about the city. If you’re looking for things to do and places to go, we’ll try to show you some at our events, but you can also check out [The List](http://www.list.co.uk/), [TripAdvisor](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Tourism-g186534-Glasgow_Scotland-Vacations.html) or [Yelp](http://www.yelp.co.uk/glasgow) for some ideas. If you’re looking for a place to stay, we’ve got some resources to help you below.
