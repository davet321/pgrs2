Postgraduate Festival 2015 is almost here...

9th-12th JUNE 2015

This is open to all Postgraduate students and Postdocs across Strathclyde University (no membership required, just sign up and come along!). Some events will have a small fee - but as everyone knows by now PG's will save money wherever we can! And best of all you can work the events around your research...so you still have time to work AND have fun!

We think there deserves to be at least a few days a year dedicated to PG's having fun, meet other PG's and network across the University- so here it is.

Over 3 days there will be:

- Informative talks from academia and industry.
- Inter departmental sports competition...only one department can win.
- Beer and pizza night.
* Inter departmental Pub Quiz.
- Postgraduate Midsummer Ball. THE Postgraduate Event of the year. This is an excuse to get dressed up and celebrate all the hard work put in throughout the year. We donâ€™t want to say too much more at this stage, but keep your eyes peeled next week for further updates.

That's all for now,

If you have any questions let us know.
