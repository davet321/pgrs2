## PhDs at Strathclyde

We know it’s easy to get a little lost at the start of your PhD. Rules, expectations and support vary hugely from department to department (and supervisor to supervisor). Information on Strathclyde’s university and department websites can be hard to find. PGRS are trying to make the whole mess a little clearer by gathering as much information as we can here, so that we can at least point you in the right direction, but it’s still a work-in-progress. If there’s something about the PhD process or Strathclyde that’s confusing you, let us know and we’ll try to answer it here. No doubt you’re not alone.

## Five top tips when starting your PhD

1. Find your departmental office as soon as possible as this is where you are likely to have to go to hand in forms, and is where the people who are likely to answer your department specific questions will be.
2. Check out your department section of the Strathclyde website – this is where you will be able to find a lot of the forms you will need and an electronic copy of your departmental handbook.
3. Check out the [postgraduate community section](http://www.strath.ac.uk/postgrad/ "Postgrad Community") of the Strathclyde website for lots of useful info on postgraduate life at Strathclyde.
4. Also check out the [R&KE Portal](http://www.strath.ac.uk/rkeportal/ "R&KE Portal")it in on the staff student councils, generally an email will go round before each meeting asking if you have any issues that need to be brought up at the council. This is a good way to bring stuff up anonymously if that is how you want to deal with it.

  If you don’t want to talk to anyone within your department there is also support in the Union. A good place to start is the [advice hub](http://www.strathstudents.com/advicehub "Advice Hub") but you can also email the [Vice-President of Education](mailto:ussa.vpe@strath.ac.uk) whose job it is to lobby on your behalf to the university. Each faculty should also have at least one postgraduate representative who may be able to help with issues affecting your whole faculty. Contact details can be found on the [Union’s website](http://www.strathstudents.com/facultyreps/whoarethey "USSA").

Talk to us, PGRS is set up by postgraduates for postgraduates and it is likely that one of us has experienced what you are experiencing.

## Credits – How many do you need and how should you get them?

The credits system is changing so that it will be consistent across Strathclyde. The two best places to find information on credits is your departmental handbook and the [Researcher Development Programme website](http://www.strathstudents.com/facultyreps/whoarethey "RDP"). For new students, the RDP have also put together a [guide](http://www.strath.ac.uk/rdp/pgrcredits/) detailing the new Postgraduate Certificate in Researcher Professional Development.

## Reviews – How often do they happen and what do they involve?

The exact timing for reviews varies between departments, but you should expect to complete at least two major reviews, probably roughly annually, during your studies. The requirements also vary, but you may be required to write a report, give a presentation, have an informal discussion about your work or even a mini-viva. Usually, these would cover what you’ve achieved since you started or since the last review, as well as your plans for the following year. These should involve at least one person outside of your supervisory team, and unsatisfactory progress may lead to your removal from your PhD program. Remember however, the review process is not just a box-ticking exercise or an assessment of your performance, it’s also a chance for you to raise any issues you have had during your PhD.

Reviews should all be handled through the appropriate student administration system for your faculty – this is [Neptune](https://www.sbs.strath.ac.uk/neptune/ "Neptune") for Business, Engineering and HaSS, and [Spider](http://spider.science.strath.ac.uk/ "Spider") for Science. These systems should notify you when some action is expected of you. In addition to the major reviews, you may have to fill out some intermediate review forms. For more information, the best person to speak to is probably your supervisor, or there’s more information on Faculty websites: [Business](http://www.strath.ac.uk/business/research/progressreviews/), [Engineering](http://www.strath.ac.uk/engineering/postgraduates/currentstudentinfo/reviews/), [HaSS](http://www.strath.ac.uk/humanities/courses/gradschool/progressreviews/) and [Science](http://spider.science.strath.ac.uk/help/index.php/Postgraduate_records).

## Teaching – Should you be teaching and how much should you do? What is expected of you? How much will you get paid? What training will you get?

Most departments do not make teaching compulsory, although some do, or you may be required to teach dependent on your source of funding. In other departments teaching is voluntary. If you do teach, it can be a good way to earn some extra money and if you want to stay in academia after your PhD a good thing to put on your CV. However, it should never detract from your PhD so make sure that your supervisor agrees to you teaching.

PGRS, the Union and the RDP are currently campaigning to the University to ensure that all postgraduates who teach receive adequate training and that there is consistency in the amount postgraduate teachers are paid. At the moment the best way to find out how much you can expect to get paid is speak to other postgraduates within your department.
